# Business-Analyst-Capstone-Project

The final project, Enhancing Operational Efficiency in a Multi-Specialty Hospital, enabled me to apply key concepts learned in Business Analyst professional certificate, to create the following deliverables.

Requirement Gathering, Stakeholder Analysis and Project Management, Process Modeling, Data Analysis and Visualization, and Risk Assessment and Mitigation.
I used these concepts to address operational challenges within the healthcare industry. The project focuses on improving patient experience, optimizing resource allocation, and streamlining workflows in a hospital setting.

HealthFirst Care, a leading multi-specialty hospital renowned for its high-quality patient care and advanced medical facilities. The hospital has launched an initiative to enhance the overall patient experience in light of increasing patient complaints and operational challenges. The management has identified key areas for improvement, including reducing wait times, optimizing resource allocation, and improving communication between stakeholders. 

As a business analyst hired by, I was tasked with driving this initiative. My role involved gathering stakeholder requirements, analyzing existing processes, developing data-driven solutions to improve operational efficiency, developing risk assessment and mitigation plan. To complete the project successfully, I was provided with different types of hospital operational datasets, including appointment schedules and patient logs, including details of appointments, patient IDs, doctor assignments, departments, dates, times, and statuses, resource allocation records that provide information on resource types, availability status, usage hours, and dates, patient feedback and satisfaction surveys that contain satisfaction scores, feedback comments, and related patient and department details. 

Used business analysis tools such as Lucidchart and MS Visio, then data analysis tools such as Excel, IBM Cognos Analytics, and Looker. For project management, used Work Breakdown Structure, WBS templates, and risk management frameworks. Toward the end of the project, I finish key deliverables such as a Comprehensive Business Requirements Document, BRD, and Requirements Traceability Matrix, RTM, detailed process models, As-Is and To-Be workflows, dashboards visualizing key metrics, trends, and actionable insights, a written risk management plan and mitigation strategies, and a PowerPoint presentation summarizing findings and proposed solutions. 

After completing the project, I achieved outcomes including improved understanding of business challenges within the healthcare industry, enhanced ability to analyze data, model processes, and visualize insights, a portfolio-worthy project demonstrating the application of business skills to real-world problems, and practical recommendations to enhance patient experience and operational efficiency in a multi-specialty hospital.
