Used business analysis tools such as Lucidchart and MS Visio, then data analysis tools such as Excel, IBM Cognos Analytics, and Looker. For project management, you will use Work Breakdown Structure, WBS templates, and risk management frameworks. Toward the end of the project, you are expected to finish key deliverables such as a Comprehensive Business Requirements Document, BRD, and Requirements Traceability Matrix, RTM, detailed process models, As-Is and To-Be workflows, dashboards visualizing key metrics, trends, and actionable insights, a written risk management plan and mitigation strategies, and a PowerPoint presentation summarizing findings and proposed solutions.
